* Emacs Configuration

** About

While learning Emacs I've tried a lot of different prepackaged 'distros'. Most notably, as an erstwhile (neo)vim user, Doom. After learning enough via that route and additionally deciding to try to give vanilla Emacs a solid try I'm leaving the prepackaged distros behind and building my own configuration.

It won't be 100% from scratch (are they ever?) as I really like the approach of the NÎ›NO configuration project and have built from that.

Naturally my config is built 'on the shoulders of giants' where much more experienced Emacs users have gone before. With the goal of learning in mind I aim to do my best to not put anything in this config unless I understand how it works.

*** Hall of inspiration

As mentioned most of my config at this point is taken from or inspired by other, smarter, people's configs. Here they are in no particular order.

Big thanks to those from whom I have learned. (And copy and pasted from...)
